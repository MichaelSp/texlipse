<h1> Spell Checking </h1>

<h3> Introduction </h3>

<p>
Spell checking is implemented into TeXlipse by utilising an external
spell-checking program called <a href="http://aspell.net">Aspell</a>.
</p>

<h3> Setting up </h3>

<p>
First, Aspell needs to be installed. This usually means installing the Aspell
core program and one or more dictionaries. There are instructions to this in the
Aspell <a href="http://aspell.net">website</a>.
</p><p>
Next, TeXlipse needs to be configured to use Aspell. There is a preference page
titled <b>Spell Checker</b> under TeXlipse preferences, where the program path
can be specified. The default arguments should work with at least Aspell version
0.5. Older versions could also be compatible.
</p>


<h3> Running spell checker </h3>

<p> Once the setup is complete, the spell checker can be run by for the currently
open LaTeX document by selecting <b>Latex &gt; Check document spelling</b> from
the menu. If all goes well, the incorrectly spelt words in the document should
get a yellow line under them (only the misspelled words!). By default, Aspell
will skip the words appearing to be LaTeX commands. (This is controlled by the
argument <code>-t</code>.)
</p><p>
The spelling errors should also appear to the problems
log. If the problems log is not visible, it can be opened from <b>Window &gt;
Show view &gt; Problems</b>. If the spelling errors aren't visible in the problems
log, they are currently filtered out. The filters can be changed by clicking the
filter-button on the upper right corner of the problems log (the one with a yellow
arrow on it). Select <code>TeXlipse spelling error</code> from the list under
&quot;Show errors of type:&quot;.
</p><p>
The individual misspelled words can be easily corrected by selecting
a spelling error entry from the problems log and choosing <b>Quick Fix</b>
from the menu that opens by clicking right mouse button. Another way is to click
once on a misspelled word, so that the cursor moves there, then open a list of
corrections by pressing <code>Ctrl+space</code> (or what ever is the
auto-completion hot key).
</p>

<h3> Choosing language </h3>
<p>
Not all documents are written in English, so the language of the spell checker
can be changed by selecting <b>Latex &gt; Change Spelling Language</b> from the menu.
This opens a dialog box where you can type the language code of the document you
are about to check. <b>NOTE:</b> what ever you type into this text box is passed as
is to Aspell as the language argument. Therefore, make sure you type the correct
code and have installed the dictionary you need with Aspell. The language codes
Aspell uses are two-letter ISO standard language codes (some are three-letter).
These codes are listed in the Aspell's supported
<a href="http://aspell.net/man-html/Supported.html">languages</a> page.
The language code is also part of Aspell dictionary package filename.
For example, the Aspell German dictionary package is called
aspell-<b>de</b>-0.50-2.tar.bz2 (or something similar).
</p><p>
Some common language codes:
<br/>
<ul>
<li>English: en</li>
<li>German: de</li>
<li>French: fr</li>
<li>Spanish: es</li>
<li>Finnish: fi</li>
