<h1>Miscellaneous editor functions</h1>

<h2><a name="com"></a>Code commenting</h2>

<p>
The plug-in offers an effective way to comment (and uncomment) multiple lines 
at once. There are four ways to do this: Select the area to comment and</p>

<p><ol>
<li>Click the "Comment selection" button at the tool bar. 
(Yellow arrow to the right towards a %-character.)<br>
<img src="images/comment.gif" alt="Comment selection"><br>
To uncomment a selection, click the "Uncomment selection" button at the tool bar.
(Yellow arrow to the left away from the %-character.) </li>
<li>Select <b>Latex &gt; Comment</b> from the menu bar<br>
To uncomment select <b>Latex &gt; Uncomment</b> from the menu bar
<li>Press <b>ctrl + 5</b> to comment the selection<br>
or press <b>esc</b> <b>ctrl + 5</b> to uncomment the selection.</li>
<li>Open the context menu (click the right button of the mouse on the editor view)
	and select (under the Source-menu)
	<b>Comment</b> to comment or <b>Uncomment</b> to uncomment the selected area.</li>
</ol></p>

<p>
Note: The command will add a "% "-string to every selected line. If there are no
lines selected, the "% "-string is added to the line where the cursor is. If
the command is executed multiple times, then a "% "-string is added
at the beginning of the selected lines every time the command is executed.
Uncommenting is similarly cumulative,
that is, it removes the first "% " (or "%") from the beginning of the line.
</p>

<p> If you wish to fold commented sections, you can use \begin{comment} 
and \end{comment} to mark the commented area.
</p>

<h2><a name="fol"></a>Code folding</h2>

<p>The user can fold text blocks by clicking the small triangles in the text editor's
left margin. The following blocks can be folded: 

<ul>
	<li>Sectioning areas: <code>\part, \chapter, \section, \subsection,
	\subsubsection, \paragraph</code></li>
	<li>The preamble</li>

<!--<li>Sections,</li><li>Subsections,</li><li>Subsubsections,</li>
,<li>Parts,</li><li>Chapters,</li><li>Paragraphs and</li>-->

<li>All environments (e.g. figures, tables &mdash; those defined with 
<i>\begin{...}</i> and <i>\end{...}</i>) except <i>\begin{document} ... \end{document}</i></li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>Folds are hierarchical, e.g. folding a section folds all subsections
under it.</p>

<p>
Note: If you wish to fold comments, you have to mark a commented block with the
<i>\begin{comment} </i> and <i>\end{comment}</i> keywords.
</p>

<p>You can also select what environments are folded initially when the
editor is opened. This can be done via <b>Code Folding</b> page at 
the Preferences. (<b>Window &gt; Preferences &gt; Texlipse &gt; Editor &gt; 
Code Folding</b>)</p>

<p>
<img src="images/folding.gif" alt="Preferences - Code Folding"><br>
Check the environments that you want to be folded. 
</p>

<p>If you wish to add new environments, click the <b>New...</b> -utton and type 
the name of the environment. For example, if you want to have every
<code>equation</code> block folded initially, click the <b>New...</b> button, type
<code><b>equation</b></code> (do <em>not</em> write 
\begin{equation}) and accept the value
by clicking the <b>OK</b> button. 
</p>

<p> If you don't want to have some environment folded automatically anymore, 
select the environment and click the <b>Remove</b>-button.</p>

<p>The <i>Up</i> and <i>Down</i> buttons do not affect anything.</p>


<h2><a name="anno"></a>Error annotations</a></h2>

<p>
The plug-in tries to indicate if there are errors in the document.
For example, if <b><code>\ref</code></b> or <b><code>\cite</code></b> are 
referring to references 
that do not exist, a warning annotation is shown. Also, subsections without a
preceding section (or subsubsection without a preceding subsection) cause
a warning annotation (the warning annotation is a yellow triangle with a black
exclamation mark).
</p>

<p>It is worth noting that referencing errors are displayed conservatively,
i.e. a warning always indicates an unresolved reference (unless you use imports
from outside of the project defining references), but some references without
an error marker shown can be wrong. Since <code>\thebibliography</code> is not
supported, bibliography entries defined with it are not taken into
account when checking <code>\cite</code> -commands.</p>

<p>If there are some serious problems, e.g. unbalanced begin-end -blocks, 
the error annotation is shown (the error annotation is a red circle 
with a white X-mark). A common problem is a missing } -brace. { and } are
always special characters in LaTeX (excluding the <code>verb</code> 
and <code>verbatim</code> environments) and in text you should escape
them by writing \{ and \} if you want them to show up in the output.</p>

<p>There are many cases where TeXlipse warns the user
of a situation that is likely wrong and issues a warning, but in situations that
are obviously wrong, an error is issued. In particular, unbalanced begin-end blocks
and missing } make it impossible to continue parsing the document, so the outline and
code folds cannot be updated until these problems are fixed in the document.
Some of the errors come as a
result of building from the <code>latex</code>-program and these are all
shown as error annotations.</p>

<p>The rule of thumb is that if the <code>latex</code>-program halts with 
the problem it is annotated with an error annotation. Otherwise it is annotated
with a warning annotation.</p>


<h2><a name="wor"></a>Word counting</h2>

<p>
To count how many words there are in the selected area, select
<b>Latex &gt; Word count</b> from the menu bar. Word counting can also
be performed by clicking the Word count icon in the toolbar.
</p>

<p>The aim is to count the words that will appear in the output document.
Every word in the text is counted as one word, one citation as one word 
and the words in the argument of a sectioning command are counted, 
everything else is not considered. If the selection contains commented lines, 
the words on those lines are not counted.
