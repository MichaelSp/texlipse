	<title>Using BibLaTeX</title>
</head>

<body>
  <p>BibLaTeX can be used as an alternative to BibTeX for handling
  bibliographies.</p>

  <p>BibLaTeX-support in TeXlipse is activated simply by putting
  <code>\usepackage[<i>your biblatex options</i>]{biblatex}</code> in the
  preamble of your document. Currently TeXlipse can make use of the backends
  <strong>BibTeX</strong> and <strong>Biber</strong>. BibTeX is the default
  backend for BibLaTeX; Biber is however by now the recommended standard.
  You can switch to Biber by including <code>backend=biber</code> in your
  BibLaTeX options.</p>

  <p>Before you use BibLaTeX, please make sure that the backend of your
  choice (<strong>Biber</strong> or <strong>BibTeX</strong>) is installed and
  set up in the <a href="configuration.html">Builder Settings</a>
  (<strong>Texlipse > Builder Settings</strong>).
  If you have been updating from an earlier version of TeXlipse, we also
  recommend adding the extensions <code>.bcf</code> and <code>.run.xml</code>
  to the temporary files extension list in the preferences <strong>Texlipse >
  Builder Settings > Latex Temp Files</strong>.</p>
